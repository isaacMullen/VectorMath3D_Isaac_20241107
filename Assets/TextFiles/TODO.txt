-Initial Plan for Game-

The Enemy needs to track the last detected position of the player and store it in case the player "dissapears" 
behind a wall so they can avoid trying to run through walls

track the players position on valid raycast hit

if the player isnt detected by a raycast. Move to the last tracked position instead of moving to the players position
