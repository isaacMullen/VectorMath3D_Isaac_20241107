TO-DO

Visually display the detection zone so the player more easily tell when they will be detected
Add a player controller

Add an animation that will loop when the enemy hasn't detected anyone. (He will look back and forth)

















DONE ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-The Enemy needs to track the last detected position of the player and store it in case the player "dissapears" 
behind a wall so they can avoid trying to run through walls

-track the players position on valid raycast hit

-if the player isnt detected by a raycast. Move to the last tracked position instead of moving to the players position
