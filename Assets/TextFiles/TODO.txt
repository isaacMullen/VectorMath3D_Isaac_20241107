TO-DO

Add a player controller



















DONE ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-The Enemy needs to track the last detected position of the player and store it in case the player "dissapears" 
behind a wall so they can avoid trying to run through walls

-track the players position on valid raycast hit

-if the player isnt detected by a raycast. Move to the last tracked position instead of moving to the players position

-Add an animation that will loop when the enemy hasn't detected anyone. (He will look back and forth)
